# IssueTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.12.

## Summary

This is an application for managing and tracking issues using `Angular Reactive Forms` module and `Clarity Design System` for styling.

The user can also resolve a selected issue.

## Futur improvements to the app

- Create an Angular component to edit the details of an existing issue (The component should
  display the issue number and allow the user to change the title, description, and priority). The
  title and the description should be required fields.
- The user should be able to access the previous component using the action menu in the list of
  pending issues. Add a new action menu button to open the edit issue form.
- After the user has completed updating an issue, the form should be closed, and the list of pending
  issues should be refreshed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
